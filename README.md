# FARADS_GEOM

## FARADS - Fast and Accurate calculation of RADiation heat transfer between arbitrary three-dimensional Surfaces

FARADS provides a model for calculating view factors of arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. With these view factors the additional application of the net radiation method for calculating exchanged heat fluxes can be used.

other modules of FARADS:
- FARADS_MESHING
- FARADS_PLOT
- FARADS_VFCALC
- FARADS_QRAD

This module provides functions and types for geometrical objects for use in the other modules of FARADS.
